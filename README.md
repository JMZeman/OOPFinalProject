### Language purpose/genesis
- Released in 2000 C# was intended to be a modern general purpose language while being portale with its C and C++ predecessors. Often accused of imitating or being a clone of java but its lead architect Hejlsberg has denied this.
- First apeared in 1983 C++ was renamed from C with classes. It was designed as a low level language with classes that went by the philosophy of trusting the programer. It was wanted to let the programer do whatever they wanted.
