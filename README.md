### Language purpose/genesis
- Released in 2000 C# was intended to be a modern general purpose language while being portale with its C and C++ predecessors. Often accused of imitating or being a clone of java but its lead architect Hejlsberg has denied this.
- First apeared in 1983 C++ was renamed from C with classes. It was designed as a low level language with classes that went by the philosophy of trusting the programer. It was wanted to let the programer do whatever they wanted.
### Unique features of the language
Not necisarly complete unique currently but features of the language advertised when first released.
- C#
  1. Generics
      >C# will include a type-safe, high-performance version of generics which differs slightly in syntax and greatly in implementation from templates as found in C++ and generics as proposed for the Java language
  2. Iterators
      >An iterator is a language construct based on similar features in research languages such as CLU, Sather and Icon. Simply put, iterators make it easy for types to declare how the foreach statement will iterate over their elements.
  3. Anonymous Methods
      >Anonymous methods are another practical language construct that allows programmers to create code blocks that can be encapsulated in a delegate and executed at a later time. They are based on a language concept called a lambda function and are similar to those found in Lisp and Python.
  4. Partial Types
      >Partial types allow you to break up types consisting of a large amount of source code into several different source files for easier development and maintenance. Furthermore, partial types allow you to separate machine-generated and user-written parts of your types so that it is easier to supplement or modify code generated by a tool.
