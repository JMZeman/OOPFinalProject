### Language purpose/genesis
- Released in 2000 C# was intended to be a modern general purpose language while being portale with its C and C++ predecessors. Often accused of imitating or being a clone of java but its lead architect Hejlsberg has denied this.
- First apeared in 1983 C++ was renamed from C with classes. It was designed as a low level language with classes that went by the philosophy of trusting the programer. It was wanted to let the programer do whatever they wanted.
### Unique features of the language
Not necisarly complete unique currently but features of the language advertised when first released.
- C#
  1. Generics
      >C# will include a type-safe, high-performance version of generics which differs slightly in syntax and greatly in implementation from templates as found in C++ and generics as proposed for the Java language
  2. Iterators
      >An iterator is a language construct based on similar features in research languages such as CLU, Sather and Icon. Simply put, iterators make it easy for types to declare how the foreach statement will iterate over their elements.
  3. Anonymous Methods
      > Anonymous methods are another practical language construct that allows programmers to create code blocks that can be encapsulated in a delegate and executed at a later time. They are based on a language concept called a lambda function and are similar to those found in Lisp and Python.
  4. Partial Types
      > Partial types allow you to break up types consisting of a large amount of source code into several different source files for easier development and maintenance. Furthermore, partial types allow you to separate machine-generated and user-written parts of your types so that it is easier to supplement or modify code generated by a tool.
 - C++
   1. Classes
       > Allows you to create defined data types and leads to several other features
   2. Inheritance
       > Can take on propeties of other defined data types
       1. Multiple Inheritance
           >unique among C++ is the ability to directly inherit from multiple classes
   3. Encapsulation
       > Ability to hide data within a structure
   4. hybrid language
       > able act like a oop language and something more akin to C
### Name spaces
   
### Types
 - C#
   1. C# supports the following types
       1. 
   2. Both refrence and value types are supported
   3. Value types can be created though the struct type
### Classes
 - C#
   1. Classes in C#
     > A class is a data structure that may contain data members (constants and fields), function members (methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, destructors and static constructors), and nested types.
   2. Create a new class
     1. to create a new class a class decleration is used which is an optional attribute, an optional class modifier, an optional partial modifier, the keyword class, an identifier that names the class, an optional type parameter list, an optional base class specification, an optional type constraint clause, a class body, and an optional semicolon
     ```antlr
        partial class example {
         ...
     }
     ```
   3. Constructing/initializing
     1. to initialize a class the keyword new must be used on the identifier in which case the constructor will be used. The defualt constructor is used unless you create one in the class.
     ```antlr
     new example();
     ```
   4. Destructing/de-initializing
     1. You can free memory taken by an instance by implementing destructors in C#
### Instance reference name in data type
 - C#
   1. "this" is used to refrence the class that you are currently in.
### Properties
 - C#
   1. getters and setters are implemented in C#
     ```antlr
     public string getterSetter { get; set; }
     ```
   2. backing variables is done automaticly in compile time so
   
       ```antlr
       private string getterSetter;
       public string GetterSetter
       {
          get {return getterSetter;}
          set {getterSetter = setter;}
       }
       ```
       
       is the same as the shorthand example
### Interfaces / protocols 
 - C#
   1. C# supports interfaces
   2. C# interfaces can inherit from multiple other interfaceses and be implimented by a class or struct who can impliment multiple interfaceses.
     1. memebers of an interface must be public
   3. An interface is used as a contract that forces those that impliment to adhere to it.
### Inheritance / extension
 - C#
   1. C# supports inheritance of only one class
   2. extensions are implemented though extension methods. They are made useing a static class in which the class you want to extend is brought into scope with the namespace.
### Memory management 
### Comparisons of references and values
 - C#
   1. C# == can be used to compare value equality for simple data types. for complex data types the Equal() method is prefered though if both are values compared are explecitly the same type == can still be used. ReferenceEquals() can be used to compare the reference of two objects
### Null/nil references 
 - C#
   1. C# uses null and it is the defualt value for refrence types. Can be used for value types if an optional is used on the type.
   2. C# has null exeptions 
### Errors and exception handling
 - C#
   1. Errors are handled using a try catch clause with an error causing the program to look for a catch clause. Errors must be represented by an instance class.
### Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types
 - C#
   1. Lambda expressions use a =>
        ```antlr
        x => x * x
        ```
        means x is x squared
   2. C# uses delegates to pass functions as types wich allows you to pass a function as a parameter.
   
### Implementation of listeners and event handlers
 - C#
   1. 
### Singleton
 - C#
   1. Singletons are implimented via a [pattern](http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Singleton.aspx)
    
    ```antlr   
   public sealed class Singleton
    {
    private static Singleton instance = null;
    private static readonly object padlock = new object();

    Singleton()
    {
    }

        public static Singleton Instance
        {
            get
            {
                lock (padlock)
                {
                    if (instance == null)
                    {
                        instance = new Singleton();
                    }
                    return instance;
                }
            }
        }
    } 
```

Which is thread safe

   2. There is also a pattern for lazy [implimentation](http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Singleton.aspx)
    ```antlr    
   public sealed class Singleton
    {
        private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> lazy =
            new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());
    
        public static Singleton Instance { get { return lazy.Value; } }

        private Singleton()
        {
        }
    } 
    
    ```
    
### Procedural programming 
### Functional programming 
### Multithreading
 - C#
   1. C# has threads wich is how multitasking is acomplished. by creating multiple threads it allows the programmer to run things in parallel
